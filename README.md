# Battleship

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Welcome to the world of battleships. Place you ships and fire away! 
  This game was both an awesome and a challenging undertaking for a team of 4 talented web developers. We built this Battleship game to be played against the computer. It is your standard game of battleship where users place their own ships and try to guess the locations of enemy ships before the computer guesses theirs!
